# age-weighted-roulette

This code was originally an age-weighted roulette used for personal use, to decide which series to watch and which games to play. I have a large list of games and series to consume, but have a hard time deciding which one to go for.
But as it is easily extensible to general purpose, I decided to adapt it.
