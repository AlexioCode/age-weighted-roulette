# age-weighted-roulette

This code was originally an age-weighted roulette used for personal use, to decide which series to watch and which games to play. I have a large list of games and series to consume, but have a hard time deciding which one to go for.
But as it is easily extensible to general purpose, I decided to adapt it.

The elements of the list can be succeeded by a date field that represents when you added it to the list. This is the format:
> Darkwood, 29/02/2023

If you don't specify any date, the element's date will be setted to current time.
